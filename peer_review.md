## Improvements/Issues with Existing Search Feature
- Feature name should be clear and precise.
- Scenario should define the functional flow of use case, avoid using technical terms like go to header.
- Steps should be clear and to the point so that feature file can also be used by non technical users. 
- URL of application should be configurable so that same test can be ran on multiple environments.

## Syntax error

- **Scenario Outline** was used in test but relevant **Examples** table was missing which resulted in a compilation error.
